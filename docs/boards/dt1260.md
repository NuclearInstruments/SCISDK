# DT1260 Board Driver

The board has a very simple font end. It is possible to configure only the input offset of the analog front end.

The only node available is `board0:/boardapi/analog.offset` and it is a float value that can be set to any value between 0 and 4095. 
The input to the ADC will be in the middle of the range when the offset is set to 2048.

# How to use the boardapi/analog node

### C/C++
```c
    int op_res=0;
    op_res |= SCISDK_SetParameterInteger("board0:/boardapi/analog.offset", 2048, _sdk);
```

### Python
```python
    sdk.SetParameter("board0:/boardapi/analog.offset", 2048)
```
