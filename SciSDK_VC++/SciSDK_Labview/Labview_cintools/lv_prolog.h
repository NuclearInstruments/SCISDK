	@brief  Ensure proper structure alignment for data structures. Bookend with lv_epilog.h.

	Data structures requiring platform-specific structure alignment should include this
	header prior to the definition of the structure. You must then include lv_epilog.h
	to restore structure packing to its previous setting.

	@note Never put include guards in this header. It is designed to be included multiple times.
	
	@note Take care to when including other headers between a lv_prolog.h / lv_epilog.h pair -
	      be careful to ensure consistency across software components.

	Example usage:
	@code
	#include "some_header.h"

	#include "platdefines.h"
	#include "lv_prolog.h"

	typedef struct {
		int m_int;
		double m_double;
	} MyStruct;

	#include "lv_epilog.h"

	@endcode
